# RAG-Enhanced CLIP for Advanced Visual Question Answering and Text-Image Retrieval

---


## Project Overview

This project develops a robust Visual Question Answering (VQA) system by integrating the **CLIP** (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training) model with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework. The system performs semantic matching between textual queries and visual content while generating contextually rich, knowledge-enhanced responses.

By combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques, the model advances multimodal understanding to solve real-world problems effectively.

## Architecture & Pipeline

- **Image Encoding:** Uses ResNet50 to extract visual features.  
- **Text Encoding:** Uses DistilBERT to encode textual queries.  
- **Shared Embedding Space:** Projects both image and text embeddings into a shared 256-dimensional space.  
- **Contrastive Learning:** Optimizes cosine similarity to align correct image-text pairs and separate incorrect ones.  
- **External Knowledge Retrieval:**  
  - Extracts keywords from CLIP-generated captions.  
  - Queries external knowledge bases (DBPedia) for enriched context.  
  - Stores and retrieves embeddings efficiently using the Chroma vector database.  
- **RAG Framework:** Employs large language models (OpenAI's GPT) to synthesize retrieved knowledge with visual data into detailed, context-aware answers.
